# General Development Rules

- Use pnpm as the package manager exclusively
- Use Biome for linting and formatting (NOT ESLint)
- Write comments in English with clarity and purpose
- Follow TypeScript strict mode practices
- Keep dependencies minimal and well-maintained
- Use workspace protocol for cross-package imports
- Run `pnpm check` before committing changes
- Test Cloudflare Pages compatibility with `pnpm pages:build`
